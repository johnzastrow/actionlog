- **Progress tracking** by movement for PR analysis
- API endpoints for workout management:
  - POST /api/workouts - Create workout with movements

### Added - Design Refinements (Planned for v0.3.0)
**Refined design decisions documented** through user consultation (not yet implemented):

**Email Verification System:**
- Optional email verification with feature unlock approach
- Users can immediately use core features without verification
- Email verification unlocks leaderboard participation and data export
- Verification email sent on registration with resend capability
- Added `email_verified` and `email_verified_at` fields to users table

**Personal Records (PR) Tracking:**
- Auto-detection system for PRs:
  - Highest weight for strength movements (per user, per movement)
  - Fastest time for time-based WODs (per user, per WOD)
  - Most rounds+reps for AMRAP WODs (per user, per WOD)
- Manual PR flag/unflag capability for user corrections
- PR badges displayed on workout cards in dashboard and history
- PR indicators (⭐) shown in movement history lists
- Added `is_pr` field to `workout_wods` and `workout_strength` tables

**Leaderboard System with Scaled Divisions:**
- Three-division leaderboard system:
  - **Rx (As Prescribed)**: Workout performed exactly as specified
  - **Scaled**: Modified workout (lighter weight, fewer reps, substitute movements)
  - **Beginner**: Simplified version for newer athletes
- Users self-select division when logging WOD scores
- Separate leaderboards for each division to ensure fair comparisons
- Global leaderboards for standard benchmark WODs
- Email verification required for leaderboard participation
- Added `division` field to `workout_wods` table

**Hybrid Workout Template System:**
- Users can use pre-defined WODs and admin-created templates
- Users can create and save their own custom workout templates
- "Save as Template" option when logging workouts
- Template management UI for create, edit, delete operations
- Both standard and custom content searchable and filterable

**Hybrid Movement/WOD Libraries:**
- Pre-defined library of standard CrossFit movements and WODs
- Users can add custom movements and WODs
- `is_standard` flag distinguishes pre-defined vs. user-created content
- Standard content cannot be edited by regular users
- Added `is_standard` field to `wods` and `strength_movements` tables

**Workout Scheduling:**
- Users can schedule workouts for future dates
- Calendar view distinguishes scheduled vs. completed workouts
- "Complete Scheduled Workout" flow for pre-planned training
- No push notifications initially (infrastructure ready for future)

**Performance Analytics:**
- Weight progression charts for strength movements
- Workout frequency heatmap showing consistency and streaks
- WOD leaderboards with division filters
- Focus on three primary visualizations

**Import/Export Enhancements:**
- Support for three formats: CSV, JSON, and Markdown
- CSV for spreadsheet compatibility and data analysis
- JSON for complete structured backup/restore
- Markdown for formatted workout reports
- Date range selection for partial exports
- Data type selection (Workouts, WODs, Movements, Profile)

**Data Sync Strategy:**
- "Last write wins" conflict resolution for offline sync
- Most recent timestamp takes precedence
- Suitable for single-user workout logging scenarios
- Sync status indicator for pending operations

**User Roles:**
- Simple two-tier system: regular users and admins
- First user becomes admin automatically
- No coach or gym owner roles in initial version

### Added - Database Schema Design (Planned for v0.3.0)
- **Major schema redesign** based on logical data model requirements (documented but not yet implemented)
- New `wods` table for predefined CrossFit workouts with comprehensive attributes:
  - Source (CrossFit, Other Coach, Self-recorded)

  - Regime (EMOM, AMRAP, Fastest Time, etc.)
  - Score Type (Time, Rounds+Reps, Max Weight)
  - Description, URL, and notes fields
- New `user_workouts` junction table linking users to workout instances on specific dates

- New `audit_logs` table for audit trail and accountability
- Added `updated_by` tracking to all entities for audit purposes

### Changed - Database Schema Design (Planned for v0.3.0)
