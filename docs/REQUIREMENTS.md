## Design Decisions

The following design decisions define the core functionality and user experience of ActaLog:

### 1. Workout Template System
**Decision**: Hybrid Approach
- Users can use pre-defined WODs and admin-created workout templates
- Users can also create and save their own custom workout templates
- This provides flexibility while maintaining a curated library of standard CrossFit workouts

### 2. Personal Records (PR) Tracking
**Decision**: Auto-Detection with Manual Override
- System automatically detects PRs by comparing workout history (weight lifted, time, rounds+reps)
- Users can manually flag or unflag workouts as PRs for accuracy
- PR badges appear on workout cards in history and dashboard
- Movement detail screens show PR history with star indicators (⭐)

### 3. Social & Sharing Features
**Decision**: Public Leaderboards with Scaled Divisions
- **Leaderboard Structure**:
  - Separate leaderboards for Rx (as prescribed), Scaled (modified), and Beginner divisions
  - Users self-select their division when logging WOD scores
  - Global leaderboards for each standard WOD (benchmark, hero, girl workouts)
- **Privacy**: Email verification required to appear on leaderboards
- **No friend system initially**: Focus on global community competition
- **Future consideration**: Web Share API for social media sharing

### 4. Data Import/Export Formats
**Decision**: CSV, JSON, and Markdown Support
- **CSV**: For spreadsheet compatibility and data analysis in Excel/Google Sheets
- **JSON**: Complete structured data backup for full restore capability
- **Markdown**: For formatted workout reports and notes
- Date range selection for partial exports
- Import with data preview before confirmation

### 5. User Roles & Permissions
**Decision**: Simple Two-Tier System
- **Regular Users**: Can create workouts, log exercises, manage their own data
- **Admins**: Can manage all user accounts, create/edit standard WODs and movements, access audit logs
- **First user becomes admin** automatically
- No coach or gym owner roles initially (future consideration for multi-gym support)

### 6. Workout Scheduling
**Decision**: Future Planning Support
- Users can schedule workouts on future dates using the calendar
- No push notifications initially (PWA notification infrastructure in place for future)
- No dedicated rest day tracking (users simply don't log workouts on rest days)
- Calendar view shows scheduled vs. completed workouts with different visual indicators

### 7. Strength Movement Library
**Decision**: Hybrid Predefined + Custom Library
- App includes predefined library of standard CrossFit movements (back squat, deadlift, clean & jerk, etc.)
- Users can create custom movements for specialized exercises
- Both standard and custom movements searchable and filterable by type (weightlifting, cardio, gymnastics)
- Admin can add to standard library; users cannot edit standard movements

### 8. Offline Data Sync Conflict Resolution
**Decision**: Last Write Wins by Timestamp
- When offline data conflicts with server during sync, most recent timestamp takes precedence
- Suitable for single-user workout logging (rarely conflicts)
- Sync status indicator shows pending operations
- Future enhancement: conflict detection UI for edge cases

### 9. Performance Analytics & Metrics
**Decision**: Three Primary Visualizations
- **Weight Progression Charts**: Line graphs showing strength gains over time for specific movements (e.g., back squat 1RM)
- **Workout Frequency Heatmap**: Calendar heatmap showing workout consistency and streaks
- **WOD Leaderboards**: Global rankings for benchmark WODs with division filters
- Not initially: Volume tracking (total weight × reps), though data model supports future addition

### 10. Email Verification
**Decision**: Optional Verification with Feature Unlock
- Users can immediately use core features (logging workouts, tracking progress) without email verification
- Email verification unlocks:
  - Public leaderboard participation
  - Data export functionality
  - Future: Workout sharing and social features
- Verification email sent on registration, can be resent from profile
- Balances security with user experience

### 11. Workout Notes & Documentation
**Decision**: Per-Workout Notes with Markdown
- Each logged workout can have notes field (how it felt, modifications made, injuries, etc.)
- Notes support markdown formatting for rich text (bold, lists, links)
- Rendered as formatted text in workout detail view
- Not initially: Movement-specific notes, photo/video attachments, voice notes (future consideration)

### 12. Leaderboard Divisions & Scoring
**Decision**: Three-Division System
- **Rx (As Prescribed)**: Workout performed exactly as specified (weight, reps, movements)
- **Scaled**: Workout modified (lighter weight, fewer reps, substitute movements)
- **Beginner**: Simplified version for newer athletes
- Users self-report division when logging WOD
- Separate leaderboards prevent unfair comparisons
- Future: Admin verification for top leaderboard entries

## UI Components:
- Navigation Bar: Global navigation for product sections; includes links to Dashboard, Performance, Workouts, Profile, and Settings.
- Dashboard: Overview page with timeline of recent activity, and quick access to logging today's workout. 
- Large text fields should render markdown for formatting.

The details for the selected movement should include a list with dates and details such as times and reps. Also a line chart with date along the X axis and weight or time for the Y axis. The list should show a star for the PRs for that movement in history.
- Workout Logging Page: Form to log a new workout, including fields for date (default to today), workout type (named WOD or custom), movements (select from common list or enter custom), weights, reps, and notes. Include a submit button to save the workout, reset button to clear the form, and a cancel button to return to the previous page without saving. also include a next button to add another movement to the same workout log.

## Logical Data Model

* Each workout is composed of a warmup and zero or more strength movements, whose details include: weight, reps, and sets, plus zero or more WODs. 
* WODs are predefined combinations of activities that users can select from when logging their workouts. Users can also create custom WODs by specifying their own movements and details. Details of a WOD are Name, Source (Crossfit named workout, Other Coach, Self-recorded  with username), Type (Benchmark, Hero, Girl, Notables, Games, Endurance, Self-created), Regime (EMOM,AMRAP, Fastest Time, Slowest Round, Get Stronger, Skills), Score Type (Time [HH:MM:SS], Rounds and Reps [Rounds:Reps], Max Weight [Decimal] ), Description [Text], URL for Video or other online research [Text], Notes [Text].
  
A workout is created before logging

Said another way, the main entities in the data model are:
Workout = Warmup + WOD(s) + Strength Movement(s)

Each user can log multiple workouts each day, and each workout can include multiple strength movements and WODs. The system should also track user profiles, settings, and historical data for progress tracking. A workout is independent of other workouts and is not linked to users in the workout definition.

Each WOD can be linked to zero or more workouts, and each strength movement can also be linked to zero or more workouts. 


### Entities and Attributes

- **User**: id, name, email, password_hash, profile_picture_url, created_at, updated_at, updated_by
- **WOD**: id, name, source, type, regime, score, description, url, notes, created_at, updated_at, updated_by
- **Strength**: id, name, movement_type (weightlifting/cardio/gymnastics), created_at, updated_at, updated_by
- **Workout**: id, user_id (FK), date, notes, created_at, updated_at
- **WorkoutWOD**: id, workout_id (FK), wod_id (FK), created_at, updated_at
- **WorkoutStrength**: id, workout_id (FK), strength_id (FK), weight, reps, sets, created_at, updated_at 
- **UserWorkout**: id, user_id (FK), workout_id (FK), created_at, updated_at
- **UserSetting**: id, user_id (FK), notification_preferences, data_export_format, created_at, updated_at  
- **AuditLog**: id, user_id (FK), action, timestamp, details
- **Backup**: id, backup_date, status, file_location


### Relationships
- A **User** can log multiple **Workouts** and a workout may be used by many users on multiple days (many-to-Many) via UserWorkouts.
- A **Workout** can include multiple **Strength Movements** (Many-to-Many via WorkoutStrength).
- A **Strength Movement** can be included in multiple **Workouts** (Many-to-Many via WorkoutStrength).
- A **User** can have multiple **UserSettings**.
- A **User** can have multiple **AuditLogs**.
- A **User** can have multiple **Backups**.
- A UserWorkout links a User to a Workout they have logged.
- A **User** can have multiple **UserWorkouts**.
- A **Workout** can have multiple **UserWorkouts**.
- A **UserWorkout** links a User to a Workout they have logged.
- A **Workout** can include multiple **WODs** (Many-to-Many via WorkoutWOD).
- A **WOD** can be included in multiple **Workouts** (Many-to-Many via WorkoutWOD).
- A **User** can create multiple **WODs**.
- A **WOD** can be created by a **User**.
- A **User** can create multiple **Strength Movements**.
- A **Strength Movement** can be created by a **User**.
- Each entity should have created_at, updated_at, and updated_by fields for auditing purposes.
- Each entity should have a unique identifier (id) as the primary key.
- each WorkoutWod and WorkoutStrength should have a unique identifier (id) as the primary key. 
- Each WOD in a UserWorkout should allow a score to be recorded based on the score type defined in the WOD entity.
- Each WorkoutStrength in a UserWorkout should allow weight, reps, and sets to be recorded.
- 
- Each UserSetting should be linked to a specific User via user_id foreign key.
- 
- ### Additional Considerations
- Foreign keys (FK) should be used to establish relationships between entities.
- Indexes should be created on frequently queried fields for performance optimization.
- Data integrity constraints should be enforced to maintain consistency across related entities.
- Consideration for scalability and future expansion of the data model should be taken into account during design.
- Normalization should be applied to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.
- Backup and recovery mechanisms should be implemented to protect against data loss.
- Security measures should be in place to protect sensitive user data, including encryption and access controls.
- Audit logging should capture significant actions performed by users for accountability and troubleshooting.
