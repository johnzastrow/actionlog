## [0.4.4-beta] - 2025-11-14

### Added
- **Retroactive PR Detection System**
  - Service method `RetroactivelyFlagPRs()` to analyze all historical workouts chronologically
  - Automatically flags PRs based on historical max values for movements and WODs
  - Processes workouts in chronological order, tracking max weights, best times, and best rounds+reps
  - Repository methods: `UpdatePRFlag()` for both movements and WODs
  - API endpoint: `POST /api/workouts/retroactive-flag-prs` (authenticated)
  - Command-line script `scripts/retroactive_prs.go` for direct database PR flagging
  - Returns count of movement PRs and WOD PRs flagged

### Fixed
- PR detection now works for historical workouts logged before PR system was implemented
- Personal Records view now displays PRs from all workouts, not just newly logged ones
- Resolved issue where existing workouts had `is_pr = 0` even when they contained record performances

### Technical
- Chronological processing ensures PRs are correctly identified based on order of performance
- In-memory tracking of max values during processing to avoid multiple database queries
- Multi-database support (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL) for PR flag updates
- Clean Architecture maintained: domain interfaces → repository implementation → service logic → handler/script

### Changed
- Version bumped to 0.4.4-beta across all version files (pkg/version/version.go, web/package.json)
